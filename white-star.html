                <p>White Star was launched in 1999 as the first super maize meal to be enriched with Vitamin A. Its unrivalled quality has earned it premium status in South Africaâ€™s maize meal market. White Star offers consumers exactly what they are looking for in a super maize meal: it cooks quickly and easily, is always white, has a fluffy texture, tastes good and is a rich source of energy. It also contains a host of nutrients, including Vitamin A, Folic Acid, Iron, four B-vitamins and Zinc. White Star is incredibly versatile and challenges the perception that maize meal is only used in traditional, pap-based meals.
                     The product has proven to be a high quality ingredient suitable for many starters, main meals and desserts. </p>
